4. Install plug-ins, [prompt](https://github.com/publicarray/pure) and configure shell to my preferences

**These are my personal preferences and as such it is not recommended to run the commands without knowing what they do. Please inspect [my-fish](https://github.com/publicarray/my-fish/) beforehand**
